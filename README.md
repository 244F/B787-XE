# Boeing 787-XE - A Microsoft Flightsimulator 2020 Mod
We have just started working on a mod for the Boeing 787-10. There is a lot of effort going into this mod. We are currently working on implementing all MFS Pages and improving the FMC. There is a lot more to come. We can't wait to improve the 787-10.

## Features
### FMC
- Descent Forecast
### MFD
- Door Page
- Gear Page

We can't offer much more right now because we just started working on it, but we are working on many different things.

## Installation
Just download the source code and copy the inner "B787-XE" folder into your community folder of MSFS 2020.
